Epydemy version 1.0 - 2014-04-21

Manifest
========

I like the game Plague on smartphone...but can't play it. And isn't it sad
that it doesn't have a cli interface ? As an exercise and to have something
to play with, I decided to implement my own version. And to add some
challenge, this is an IT version where one controls a computer virus and has
to destroy every computer in the world.

Enjoy !

To the user
===========

Sorry, this is not usable yet. Be patient baby.

If you really are impatient you can use our testing interface simple_ui to
try it but it will really not be playable before v2.0.

To the programmer
=================

This is a python3.4 project. Please be sure to follow the PEP8 coding style.
Although this I am french, the project is in english.

http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ (english)
http://sametmax.com/le-pep8-en-resume/      (french)

The requirements are:
    docopt  https://github.com/docopt/docopt
    pyyaml  http://pyyaml.org/
    nose    https://github.com/nose-devs/nose

Each can be installed using pip.

TODO
====

We are now in a phase where we start to have something usable and are
thinking about turning it into a real game.

Yet the objectives are:

[x] create a cli ui
[ ] create a curses ui
[?] define a clear victory scenario
[ ] add basic multiplayer possibilities
[x] add in-content messages or images
[?] change prices of skills to add to player frustration
[w] improve the game mechanics to make it fun
[ ] add stuff to populate the game
[w] write more tests

Legend: [ ] Todo | [x] Finished | [?] Need Test | [w] In Work | [s] Stopped

The long-term objectives are the creation of a graphical ui (with pygame or
qt), a diversification of the types of viruses to have different behaviours,
objectives making it funnier, a pre-release in a month or so.
