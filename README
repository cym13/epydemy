Epydemy version 0.6 - 2014-04-21

Manifest
========

I like the game Plague on smartphone...but can't play it. And isn't it sad
that it doesn't have a cli interface ? As an exercise and to have something
to play with, I decided to implement my own version. And to add some
challenge, this is an IT version where one controls a computer virus and has
to destroy every computer in the world.

Enjoy !

To the user
===========

Sorry, this is not usable yet. Be patient baby.

To the programmer
=================

This is a python3.4 project. Please be sure to follow the PEP8 coding style.
Although this I am french, the project is in english.

http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ (english)
http://sametmax.com/le-pep8-en-resume/      (french)

The requirements are:
    docopt  https://github.com/docopt/docopt
    pyyaml  http://pyyaml.org/
    nose    https://github.com/nose-devs/nose

Each can be installed using pip.

TODO
====

Almost everything :)

Yet the objectives are:

[x] create the basics of the architecture
[x] create the basics of the mechanics
[x] add some basic data to allow testing
[x] create a base of tests
[x] create a basic ui
[x] add save/load
[?] improve the game mechanics to something usable
[ ] add stuff to populate the game
[w] improve the ui
[ ] write tests

Legend: [ ] Todo | [x] Finished | [?] Need Test | [w] In Work | [s] Stopped

There will be v0.1, and we will be able to move forward more complex game
mechanics, ui and user experience.
